This HowTo covers an oil change on a Honda Pioneer 2019 700 Deluxe. It should apply to other years and models, although part numbers may vary. It should also be noted that these steps were performed on a Pioneer that had already been through the initial 25 hour service at the dealer!

## Oil Change Intervals

Oil change intervals are ever X miles or Y hours in optimal conditions. Operating in hostile conditions will require more frequent service (you know who you are :-) ).

| Mileage | Hours | Description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |

> [!NOTE] Oil Quantity 3.5 US Qt
> The user manual states that you'll need `3.1` US quarts for for the oil change, however I found that I needed about `3.5` US quarts to reach the half way point on the dip stick (you check the level with the dipstick **seated but unscrewed**)

Additionally, the manual also states that the o-rings and drain plug washer be replaced at each oil change, however enthusiasts routinely skip replacing these during oil changes based on o-ring / washer damage, YMMV.  Regardless, it's a good idea to keep multiple o-rings and washers on hand, as the o-rings are especially prone to damage.

## Tools

- 10mm: 4 x bolts protective underbelly cover under the drain bolt
- 12mm: Oil filter bolt
- 16mm: Oil drain plug bolt

## Torque

- 4 x Protective underbelly bolts: `9 lbf·ft (12 N·m, 1.2 kgf·m)`
- Oil filter bolt: `13 lbf·ft (18 N·m, 1.8 kgf·m)`.
- Oil drain plug bolt: `18 lbf·ft (25 N·m, 2.5 kgf·m)`

## Draining The Oil

> [!NOTE] Avoid an Oily Mess
> The oil will shoot out of the drain hole about 1 to 1 1/2 feet once the drain plug is removed. As the oil is drained, this will reduce enough that you'll likely have to move the pan closer to the drain hole.

> [!NOTE] Removing the Filter
> When removing the oil filter, unscrew the bolt but leave it in the filter, removing the full `filter/bolt/washer/spring` assembly as a single unit. If you don't do this, you will likely have to search for the filter washer / spring.

The user manual suggests to place the transmission in drive, 4x4 in differential lock and apply the parking break. Basically, all the things that can help prevent the vehicle from rolling while you are working on it!

I chose to jack the Pioneer at the front (place the jack under the brush gaurd, see owners manual), and use jack stands at the frame jack points near the front wheels. This may not be necessary, I'll have to try without next time, but made it easier the first time.

First step, remove the seat. You'll access the oil fill cap, dipstick (driver side) and filter (passenger side) under the front seat. Unscrew the fill cap and dipstick. Proceed to the underside of the passenger side.

PHOTO

The oil drain bolt is located inside a small access panel that is located under the Pioneer, center behind the front bench. There are 4 x `10mm` bolts.

Remove the bolts and slide the cover out towards the driver side. (I took this opportunity to clean debris out of the area).

The oil drain bolt is the larger bolt, `16mm`. When fully removed, the oil will shoot out more than a foot and will slowly decrease, meaning you'll need to occasionally move the drain pan.

While the oil is draining, remove the filter. The filter is located under the dust cover on the front passenger side (beside the battery compartment). As mentioned above, I would recommend leaving the bolt in the filter while removing everything as a unit. I didn't do this the first time, removing the bolt first. The result was both spring and washer ended up in the belly pan, taking a good bit of digging to locate.

PHOTO

The oil filter can be removed by using a `12mm` wrench / socket. Once the bolt is completely loose, use a flat bladed screw driver to **gently** pry the filter cover away from the crankcase (by gently, I mean it shouldn't require any effort). Once the cover is loose, pull the entire unit out as one and disassemble on your clean workspace (you'll need to reuse the washer, spring, cover and bolt)

## Reinstall the Filter

Before installing the new oil filter, you'll want to replace the o-rings located on the filter bolt and filter cover (again, you decide if the o-rings need to be replaced, FYI they are cheap at your local dealer). When replacing o-rings, always make sure to lubricate them with the same oil, i.e. dip your finger in the oil and coat the o-ring!

Assemble the filter as follows: **filter** -> **washer** -> **spring** -> **filter cover** -> **filter bolt**

Next you'll want to hand thread the filter bolt before using a wrench. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do this. I couldn't get the bolt to turn with my thumb and forefinger. I ended up having to trust that my very **light** use of the wrench wasn't cross threading teh bolt. I believe that t=his is due to the bolt passes through 2 tight seals on the filter (friction when trying to twist the bolt). You won't have a lot of room for two hands!

Once you have the filter cap snug, tighten to `13 lbf·ft (18 N·m, 1.8 kgf·m)`..

## Reinstall the Oil Drain Bolt

Replace the o-ring and washer on the drain bolt and hand tighten. Once hand tightened, torque to `18 lbf·ft (25 N·m, 2.5 kgf·m)`.

## Reinstall Access Panel

Replace the access panel (the longer flange goes towards the rear). Hand tighten the 4 bolts and then torque to `9 lbf·ft (12 N·m, 1.2 kgf·m)`.

## Fill the Oil

Start by filling the oil with 3 US quarts.
