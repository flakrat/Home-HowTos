## Tools

- 14mm socket/wrench
- 21mm socket/wrench
- 11/16" open end wrench

- Socket elbow/universal joint for filter wrench and ratchet
- Zip ties in case you need to cut any for wiggle room

## Torque

- Drain Plug: 10 ft-lb

## Draining The Oil

The oil drain plug is located on the left side of the engine (when facing from the rear) under the hydro reservoir.

**Note:** You may want to jack the right side tire up a bit by driving it onto a 2x4 to give it a bit of tilt for draining. I didn't do while doing this oil change and the oil drain was SLOW. I thought about temporarilly jacking it with a floor jack but couldn't find a good location for the jack.

Use a 21mm socket/wrench on the drain plug and an 11/16" wrench to counter the torque when loosening the plug. I find it handy to use my Milwaukee 90 degree M12 impact wrench for loosening the drain plug.

Remove the drain cap and allow the oil to drain.

## Filter Removal

- I like to loosen the right hand side 14mm bolt that allows the side to swing out. This will give you more room to reach the filter.
- Remove the fan shroud by working it outward toward the tire
- Place a few shop towels under the filter, but over the sensor with the green wire that sits below 
- Use a 75mm with 14 flute oil filter wrench with with socket set universal joint and ratchet to loosen the filter. I worked the filter wrench and universal joint in from the top working toward the back and down. Once seated, it only took a slight turn of the wrench to break it free so that it was finger loose.

- Remove the socket wrench followed by the filter wrench and universal joint

## Plug & Filter Install

- Install oil drain plug and tighten to 10 ft-lb using 11/16" open end wrench to provide counter torque
- Fill the filter with oil to the threads, allow 2 mintues or so to soak into the element
- Install the filter and hand tighten

## Fill the Oil

Fill with 2 quarts of 10w30 full synthetic oil. While doing so, check for leaks at the filter and drain plug

Reinstall the fan shroud, close the side and tighten the 14mm nut
