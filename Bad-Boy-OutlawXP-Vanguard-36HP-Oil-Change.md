## Tools

- 14mm / 9/16 socket/wrench - swing sides out
- 17mm wrench - counter torque for drain plug install/removal
- 21mm socket/wrench - Drain plug
- Oil Filter Wrench: 75mm with 14 flutes (not required, but handy. Same used for a 2004 VW Jetta TDI)
- Socket elbow/universal joint for filter wrench and ratchet
- Zip ties in case you need to cut any for wiggle room

## Torque

- Drain Plug: 10 ft-lb

## Draining The Oil

The oil drain plug is located on the left side of the engine (when facing from the rear) under the hydro reservoir.

> [!NOTE] Lift the Right Side
> You may want to lift the right side tire up a bit by driving it onto a 2x4 to give it a bit of tilt for draining. I didn't do while doing this oil change and the oil drain was SLOW.

![Oil Drain](img/2022-03-21-22-19-50.png)

Use a `21mm` socket/wrench on the drain plug and an `17mm` wrench to counter the torque when loosening the plug. I find it handy to use my Milwaukee 90 degree M12 impact wrench for loosening the drain plug.

Remove the drain cap and allow the oil to drain.

## Filter Removal

- I like to loosen the right hand side `9/16"` (`14mm` may work as well) nut that allows the side to swing out. This will give you more room to reach the filter.![[2983A791-009D-453C-9A60-8E623F5AFFFB_1_105_c.jpeg]]
- Remove the fan shroud by working it outward toward the tire
- Place a few shop towels under the filter, but over the sensor with the green wire that sits below 
- Use a `75mm x 14 flute` oil filter wrench with with socket set universal joint and ratchet to loosen the filter. I worked the filter wrench and universal joint in from the top working toward the back and down. Once seated, it only took a slight turn of the wrench to break it free so that it was finger loose.

- Remove the wrench and remove filter by hand

## Plug & Filter Install

- Install oil drain plug and tighten to 10 ft-lb using 11/16" open end wrench to provide counter torque
- Fill the filter with oil to the threads, allow 2 mintues or so to soak into the element
- Install the filter and hand tighten

## Fill the Oil

Fill with 2 quarts of 10w30 full synthetic oil. While doing so, check for leaks at the filter and drain plug

Reinstall the fan shroud, close the side(s) and tighten the 14mm nut(s)

## TODO

- Gorilla tape the parking brake handle: The rubber on the handle is starting to split
- Tighten the parking brake: Starts to roll on slight incline
- Lube the zerks
